_***AssignmentNo. 2 >***_

On branch named -
Assignment_2-Inheritance ->
     
     Assignment no 2 : Study of Ineheritance
          
          Design and develop inheritance for a given case study, identify objects and relationships and implement inheritance wherever applicable. Employee class hasEmp_name, Emp_id,
          Address, Mail_id, and Mobile_noas members. Inherit the classes: Programmer, Team Lead, Assistant Project Manager and Project Manager from employee class. Add Basic Pay (BP)
          as the member of all the inherited classes with 97% of BP as DA, 10 % of BP as HRA, 12% of BP as PF, 0.1% of BP for staff club fund. Generate pay slips for the employees
          with their gross and net salary.

_***AssignmentNo. 3 >***_

On branch named -
Assignment_3-Polymorphism ->
     
          Identify commonalities and differences between Publication, Book and Magazine classes. Title, Price, Copies are common instance variables and saleCopy is common method. The
          differences are, Bookclass has author and orderCopies(). Magazine Class has methods orderQty, Current issue, receiveissue().Write a program to find how many copies of the
          given books are ordered and display total sale of publication.

_***AssignmentNo. 4 >***_

On branch named -
Assignment_4-Dynamic_Binding ->

          Dynamic Binding
          Design a base class shape with two double type values and member functions to input the data and compute_area() for calculating area of shape. Derive two classes:
          triangle and rectangle. Make compute_area() as abstract function and redefine this function in the derived class to suit their requirements. Write a program that
          accepts dimensions of triangle/rectangle and display calculated area. Implement dynamic binding for given case study.

_***AssignmentNo. 5 >***_

On branch named -
Assignment_5-Interface ->
     
          Design and develop a context for given case study and implement an interface for Vehicles Consider the example of vehicles like bicycle, car and bike. All Vehicles
          have common functionalities such as Gear Change, Speed up and apply breaks. Make an interface and put all these common functionalities. Bicycle, Bike, Car classes
          should be implemented for all these functionalities in their own class in their own way.
