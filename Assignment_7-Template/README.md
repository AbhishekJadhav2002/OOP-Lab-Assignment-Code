## Getting Started

**_Assignment No.- 7_**

    For this, Fork or Download whole folder and run at your end.

    Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `classes` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
